# hello-world
My first journey into the frightening world of code!

Chapter One: The First Step

I have no idea how I got here or what I'm doing in this frightening labyrinth. The walls are cold. Lichens of rust, beige and plum scatter the corridors. My torch is going to burn out soon. I don't know how long I can last in the darkness. I just hope I can make it to the end before then. I will keep the hope alive and channel all of my spirit into this flame.

I wonder if I fed the cats this morning? I really hope so.
